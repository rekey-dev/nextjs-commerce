/**
 * The sentence to put in front of a CUSTOMER when checkout is refused.
 *
 * `RekeyError.message` and `.fix` are written for whoever can act on the
 * problem, and for several codes that is the operator, not the buyer.
 * Rendering them on a product page shows a paying customer a sentence about
 * themselves in the third person and an instruction they cannot carry out:
 *
 *   "This subscriber pays through "paypal", which is no longer configured for
 *    this Application. ... Re-add the "paypal" credentials in Panel ->
 *    Application -> Billing ..."
 *
 * That is a real thing a buyer saw on the Next.js starter before this existed.
 * The codes below are the ones whose text names the panel, an API route, or
 * the subscriber in the third person; each gets one sentence a customer can
 * act on. Everything else falls through to the API's own `message`,
 * deliberately: a declined card, an expired coupon or a provider the buyer
 * picked being unavailable are all their situation to resolve, and the API
 * already says so in words they can use.
 *
 * Keep this list short. A code belongs here only when its text is addressed to
 * somebody other than the person reading it.
